# Ollama + Langfuse Scoring Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A comprehensive scoring system for evaluating LLM responses with Ollama and Langfuse, featuring:

1. **Automated scoring of LLM outputs** against expected answers
2. **Intentional wrong answer testing** to validate scoring accuracy
3. **Context-aware keyword matching** that detects negative contexts
4. **Complete validation framework** ensuring scoring correctness

## Key Files Created

- `ollama_scoring_example.py` - Main scoring implementation with 6 test cases
- `run_scoring_and_validate.py` - Validation script that verifies scoring behavior
- `view_scoring_results.py` - Analytics tool for viewing and exporting scores
- `SCORING.md` - Original design proposal
- `README_SCORING.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## Technical Highlights

### Scoring Methods
1. **Exact Match Scoring**
   - Extracts numbers from responses using improved regex
   - Compares against expected values
   - Used for math problems and precise answers

2. **Context-Aware Keyword Matching**
   - Detects required keywords in responses
   - Checks for negative context patterns ("who needs", "not", etc.)
   - Prevents false positives from negative mentions

### Test Design
- 6 test cases: 3 expecting correct answers, 3 expecting wrong answers
- Categories: Math, Geography, History
- Carefully crafted prompts to force wrong answers without mentioning correct ones

### Key Improvements
1. **Robust prompts** that reliably produce wrong answers
2. **Smart keyword detection** that understands context
3. **Comprehensive validation** ensuring 50/50 pass/fail rate
4. **Langfuse SDK v3 compatibility**

## Results

When running the examples:
- Average score: 0.50 (exactly as expected)
- 3 tests pass with score 1.0
- 3 tests fail with score 0.0
- Validation confirms all tests behave correctly

## Usage

```bash
# Run the main scoring example
python ollama_scoring_example.py

# Run with validation
python run_scoring_and_validate.py

# View scoring analytics
python view_scoring_results.py
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for LLM output evaluation and can be extended with semantic similarity scoring, LLM-as-judge evaluation, and direct Langfuse trace integration.
